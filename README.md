# Meeting-Rooms-III
You are given an integer n. There are n rooms numbered from 0 to n - 1.  You are given a 2D integer array meetings where meetings[i] = [starti, endi] means that a meeting will be held during the half-closed time interval [starti, endi). All the values of starti are unique.  Meetings are allocated to rooms in the following manner:  


class Solution:
    def mostBooked(self, n: int, meetings: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        ans = [0] * n
        times = [0] * n
